I grew up on the Jersey Shore about a mile from the beach. [I am a local!](http://www.bennygohome.com) My childhood revolved around sports and strategy games. I always enjoyed school, specifically my math and science courses.

In my middle school years, I discovered a talent in acting and performed in many regional and high school musicals. When I started, I had yet to hit puberty so I sounded like Mickey Mouse. I played Oliver right before my voice dropped. My favorite role I played was Igor in Young Frankenstein (yes, master!).

I went to Biotechnology High School and studied all things biology, chemistry, and physics. I joined the FFA and entered science fairs and public speaking contests at the State and National level. At the time I graduated, my high school was ranked the #8 high school in the country and #1 in the state (ranked by US News or Newsweek). It was a lot of work but it opened up a lot of opportunities and instilled in me a great work ethic that made the transition to college seamless.

As much as I tried to leave the state, I attended college in New Jersey. I studied Computer Science and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I enjoyed almost all of my classes (I took a lot of them) but I especially enjoyed my systems, cryptography, and genetics courses. Organic chemistry was tough, though. That one broke me.

I have always been really into movies and music. I usually try to see all of the movies that are nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. I had MoviePass for a few months, before all of the limits and fees. That was cool.

I follow the NBA closely (religiously). My team is the Sixers but I just love the sport and the league. It is a game of incredible athleticism and strategy.

My friends call me Mild Pete because someone thought my name was Pete once and I canâ€™t eat spicy foods.

I would like to use this blog to pass on my thoughts and to share my interests. I want to write interesting articles that teach small things but open the mind to big ideas.
