I grew up in New Jersey about a mile from the beach. My childhood revolved around sports and strategy games. I also liked school, specifically my math and science courses. As I got older I discovered a talent in acting and performed many of regional and high school musicals.

I went to Biotechnology High School and studied all things biology, chemistry, and physics. I joined the FFA and entered science fairs and public speaking contexts at the State and National level.

Currently, I am an undergraduate at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I have a major in Computer Science and a minor in Biological Sciences. I like learning about systems programming, cryptography, and bioinformatics. Basketball is one of my biggest interests outside of the classroom. I love the statistics and the storylines. I hope to work at a techology company as a software engineer.

I am starting this blog to pass on my thoughts and to share my interests. I want to write interesting articles that teach small things but open the mind to big ideas.
