This summer I kept all of my food scraps in a sealed bucket next to my kitchen. This fall, I poured the contents into a some soil beds in my garden. By spring, or earlier, these beds will be ready for planting and by summer they will be full of flowers and herbs.

This is all possible because of a concept called Bokashi composting. It is a different type of composting; one fit for a time-crunched 20-something lucky enough to have a few square feet for a garden.

I first learned about Bokashi composting from a Japanese vlogger.
