# A Near Winter Poem

```
After a final color rush
the trees lose their leaves.
We can see farther
but we don't go as far.

The heat and action of summer
now are memories.
The fleeting wonder of springtime
buried deeper and nearly forgotten.

As the season of Fall comes to a close
we gather and share gratefulness.
In the coming months we will bundle
against the cold air.

As I look through the trees
I don't see emptiness.
I can see farther
I see openness.

The air cools and the pace slows.
Fewer faces and more reflections.
In the Winter we see ourselves.

And it goes on for longer than we expect.
Every year we remember but
every year we still wait.
It takes time so that we can too.
Not to be ready for spring
but to be ready to.
```
