# The ability to create art may be the most human-specific capability that we possess.

As far as I know, other animals do not create art. Humans create art. We also think about art, talk about art, and recreate it. Certain pieces of art are among the most expensive things in the world.

A few months ago, I was in Paris. While I was there, I went to some of the top-rated fine art museums in the world ([The Louvre](http://www.louvre.fr/en), [Musee d'Orsay](http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html), [Musee Rodin](http://www.musee-rodin.fr/)). As I walked through the gardens of scultures and corridors of priceless paintings, I constantly asked myself, "What makes this special?"

There are a lot of reasons for why those particular pieces are special. I am sure that an art history student could convince me in a matter of minutes. However, this question got me thinking about what makes art special in general. What makes a movie worth watching? What makes a song worth listening to? Why bother making art?

I believe art is one of the most incredible things that humans can create. When one is looking at a piece of art, that person is looking into the mind of its creator. The viewer can almost see the inside of another person's mind. There is nothing quite like it.

Art can show perspective and depth. Art can channel emotions and feelings. It can be depressing and inspiring. Art is the only thing that separates us from a bunch of walking and talking robots. As the gap between humans and artificial intelligence begins to slowly close, hang on to the one thing that makes us who we are: art.

If you are curious about what art think is special, I have recently been watching the second season of [Stranger Things](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/) on Netflix and listening to the album Stoney by [Post Malone](https://www.youtube.com/user/postmalone).
