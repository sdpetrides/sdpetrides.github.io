# The ability to create art is one of the most human-specific capabilities that we possess.

I visited Paris a few months ago and went to some of the top-rated fine art museums in the world ([The Louvre](http://www.louvre.fr/en), [Musee d'Orsay](http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html), [Musee Rodin](http://www.musee-rodin.fr/)). As I walked through the gardens of sculpstures and corridors of priceless paintings, I constantly asked myself, "What makes this special?"

There are a lot of reasons for why those particular pieces are special. I am sure that an art history student could convince me in a matter of minutes. However, this question got me thinking about what makes art special in general. What makes a movie worth watching? What makes a song worth listening to? Why bother making art?

I believe art is one of the most incredible things that humans can create. When one is looking at a piece of art, that person is looking into the mind of its creator. The viewer can almost see the inside of another person's mind. There is nothing quite like it.

Art can show perspective and depth. Art can channel emotions and feelings. It can be depressing or inspiring. Art is what separates us from other living things (and non-living machines). As the gap between humans and artificial intelligence continues to slowly close, I will hang on to one of the things that makes us who we are: art.

If you are curious about what art think is special, I have recently been watching the second season of [Stranger Things](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/) on Netflix and listening to the album Stoney by [Post Malone](https://www.youtube.com/user/postmalone).
