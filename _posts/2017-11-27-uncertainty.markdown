# Uncertainty is the natural limit to our understanding. So how do we push through it?

Recently, I was reading one of my favorite books and it gave me a new perspective on an issue I have been dealing with a lot lately. The book is called [The Code Book](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/) by Simon Singh and it is about the history of cryptography. In the final chapter, Singh writes about one of the most recent interations of cryptography: quantum crytography. As he describes one of the first propositions in that space ([quantum money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_money)), he mentions an important concepts in quantum theory: the uncertainty principle.

The uncertainty principle was developed way back in the 1920s by physicist Werner Heisenberg. His idea goes like this.

> We cannot know, as a matter of principle, the present in all its details.

This principle is related to SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat, superposition theory, many-worlds theory, and is at the core of quantum theory. It is setting certain limits on what we can possibly measure and understand at a certain time. And while it feels restrictive and confusing, quantum theory is baked into some of the most advanced technology that humans have ever created. The list includes nuclear reactors, DNA analysis, lasers, and maybe the future of computers. The uncertainty principle is one of the most important concepts in physics and in the development of technology.

As humans, however, we are very afraid of uncertainty. We like to understand what is going on around us. Not being able to explain how we feel or how to behave gives us anxiety. We cling to the things we know and hide from the things we don't.

All of this became real in my personal life as I prepare to graduate college and enter 'the real world'. I have gotten a taste of work-life through jobs and interships but I have rarely experienced the responsibility of managing all of my time and money. This is a major source of stress. As much as I try to calm myself down, the uncertainty of the future gives me pause.

When I am stressed worrying about the challenges that lie on the horizon, I distract myself. My favorite distraction is basketball, specifically following the NBA. Recently, while I was browsing the pages of the [r/NBA](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/) subreddit, I found a clip from an interview with future Hall of Fame player Kobe Bryant.

Kobe Bryant is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world. He has won NBA Championships, Gold Medals, and has been named NBA Most Valuable Player. He is known for his iconic turn-around jumpshot and clutch shot-making abilities. To me, the most interesting about the 20-year veteran is his temperment.

Kobe doesn't [flinch](https://youtu.be/BUdLLdR8Pow). He has unmatched [toughness](https://youtu.be/_O1KVWIT-H4). It all comes from who he is as a person and how he attempts to achieve his goals. He gives us a glimpse of his mentality in this [interview](https://streamable.com/tcgso) with Jemele Hill.

> Failure doesn't exist...it is a figment of your imagination...the story continues. The only way it is a failure on Monday is if you decide to not progress from that. That is why failure it nonexistent. If I fail today, then I will learn something from that failure and then I will try again on Tuesday. Then I will try again on Wednesday.

Here, Kobe is trying to indicate to the audience that his mentality was not to be afraid of failing or focused in on winning. he attempts to take himself out of the situation entirely and looks at this as an opportunity, as a trial. For Kobe, each play or game is a time for him to get better. If what he tries does not work, he will learn from it and use that the next time. By putting himself "dead center" as he says, he there is not way he can fail. There is no fear of uncertainty.

Trying to apply this to my own life is difficult. How do we remove ourselves from a situation like he says? How do we not take things personally? How do we become fearless? Well, I am still trying to figure it out. Here is my best effort in the form of a short quote.

> You will not miss if you not afraid to.

Uncertainty is around us always. The uncertaintly principle shows us that we will never understand everything around us. Thankfully, Kobe teaches us that we don't need to. Together, these concepts demonstrate how to be comfortable with uncertainty in our own life.
