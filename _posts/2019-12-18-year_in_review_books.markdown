### Brief impressions of each of the books I read this year.

![2019 Books]({{ '/images/2019_books.jpg' }})

### The Martian (2011)

#### Andy Weir

After I really enjoyed the movie made from this book, I decided to pick it up from the shelf and give it a read. While it don't regret my decision, I do believe this is the rare case when the movie is better than the book.

Typically, movies made from books lack the depth and detail of their original form. In the case of the Martian, I found the book without a heart. It certainly packed a technical punch; there were plenty of numbers, estimates, and feats of engineering. Still, the character had no emotional depth. I struggled to reason why this astronaut fought so hard to stay alive and get home against all odds. He never describes any family or friends that he would like to get home to see. Matt Damon breathed life into this character on-screen.

### Martian Chronicles (1950)

#### Ray Bradbury

I stayed on the theme of Mars for this next book but turned to a classic that I had never read before. I enjoyed this book though I don't know if I could fully appreciate it. I would imagine there is a lot of Post-WWII ideas baked in but I could not pull them out. This is one I see myself returning to with a sharper focus.

### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2011)

#### Yuval Noah Harari

This is an incredible book. Though the word "brief" is in the title, it is a mammoth of a book. It touches on so many human-related topics that it defies simple categorization. It has elements of archeology, anthropology, theology, science, politics, economics and more. It reads well and informs even better. Harari follows the history of the species, explaining what we know and how we know it at each juncture. It contains some hot takes, but because these takes are backed with great evidence and reasoning, they challenge how we think. The book changes how we see our race; it changes how we see ourselves.

### The Gene: An Intimate History (2016)

#### Siddhartha Mukherjee

It is such a pleasure to read the work of Siddhartha Mukherjee. He makes the reader feel as brilliant as he truly is.

This book reminds me of one of my favorite books of all time: The Code Book. In both, the authors weave an engaging narrative through a long and complex history of scientific discovery and human endeavor. This book delivers on its title and goes beyond it; it changed the way I see nature around us and within us.

It raises deeply philosophical questions like, can an intelligent machine truly understand its own interworkings? And, how do we define mutation and disease?

The book also contains wonderfully interesting bits like a note about our common ancestor: "For modern humans, that number has reached one: each of us can trace our mitochondrial lineage to a single human female who existed in Africa about two hundred thousand years ago. She is the common ancestor of our species."

This is my favorite book that I read this year and one of my favorites ever.

### An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System: A Tale in Four Lives (2019)

#### Matt Richtel

Matt Richtel does very well with this grounded and connected non-fiction book. He uses real stories, as well as his own, to give context to the important discoveries of the emerging immunotherapy field. It is not as informative as the two books listed above it but it is very much a good one.

### Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith (2003)

#### Jon Krakauer

Leave it to Jon Krakauer to write a thrilling non-fiction book on the history of Mormonism. I was really locked into this one.

The book brings together two story lines: the general history of the Mormon Church and the events surrounding a present-day murder in a fundamentalist Mormon group. One provides context for the other and both, together, tell the whole story.

It was fascinating to learn about Mormanism, a very different and unique religion. However, it was enhanced by the vast existence of important artifacts. Since this religion was formed during the era of the accessible printing press, there are many juicy accounts of what happened and how things happened. Studying the birth of a religion so close to the present setting gives us a lens through which to interpret the birth of other religions.

### Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again (2019)

#### Eric Topol

This book is a throughly-researched and highly informative look at how AI/ML has and will impact research and medicine. It breaks from some of the great books above in that it does not tell a story or share a history. It is non-fiction for the sake of the spread of information.

It is packed with great takes on how AI/ML is penetrating all corners of our healthcare system. It delivers on breadth but can be short on depth. It is a good read for someone in the industry.

### Amsterdam: The History of the World's Most Liberal City

#### Russell Shorto

My final book of the year, though I may sneak one more in before the clock strikes 2020, is a wonderful book on the history of Amsterdam. I picked this book up because I was going to the city for an extended weekend and wanted to know what makes it special. It quickly became a huge fan of Amsterdam and learned an immense amount about the city and its impact on the world.

After I finished the book, I was could act as a decent tour guide for my friends; I was able to point out important places and tell stories about the historical context of buildings and sites we may have simply strolled through disconnected.

This book is well researched; so much so that I wanted to give my former history teachers a call just to chat about their favorite topics. It gave me a greater perspective on art, architecture, philosophy. It has inspired me to do my pre-reading for my future travels.
