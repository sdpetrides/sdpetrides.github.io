# I graduate from Rutgers University tomorrow. I present my grades by semester with a brief analysis.

I finished my undergrad with a major in Computer Science (CS) and a minor in Biological Science. I went through a number of different majors and programs. Most notably, I was a Cell Biology and Neuroscince (CBN) major for my second year. For this major, I was enrolled in two semesters of General Physics and Organic Chemistry. Later, I decided that I did not want to continue with that major. I began taking multiple CS courses in each semester and finished the Bachelor's of Science track in the CS degree.

The changes in color show the difference in classes I was taking. My first and second semester I was experimenting a lot with different types of classes. Then, I decided to pursue CBN. You can see that semesters three through six are packed with classes for that major. You can also see that I did not perform very well in these classes by the large dip in semester GPA. Before semester seven, I decided to focus on CS and switch to a biology minor. The following four semesters were responsible for some of my highest semester GPAs.

It is clear that the types of classes I was taking (CBN vs CS) affected my GPA whereas the number of credits did not. The more CBN classes, the lower my semester GPA. The more CS classes, the higher my GPA.

I think that this is a very common trend with college students. It takes some time to discover what classes are interesting. Once the student finds those classes, the motivation to do well is there.
