### Brief impressions of each of the books I read this year.

### Overstory (2018)

#### Richard Powers

My first book of the year was big in many regards: purpose, volume, and clout. The 2019 Pulitzer Prize winner for fiction weaved a powerful environmental epic through the lives of nine characters over the course of several decades. Though the events in the book did not occur, the story had a way of turning back to history in critical moments, much like Forrest Gump. This gave the narrative context and gravity.

The book is coated in metaphor and simile that romanticize our photosynthesizing friends but inform us on the purpose and genius of these ancient creatures. Powers slows down time to tree speed and poses important questions about purpose and cooperation. In each section there are arguments that bear philosophical fruit of many shapes. There are riffs on Buddhism, human behavior, psychology, alternative medicine, virtual existence, and of course botany and dendrology.

Powers dips into many different fields as he creates his characters. In truth, he goes waist deep into these disciplines as if Powers was once an expert himself. It gave the Powers great credibility and as a reader, I invited him to open my eyes and expand my mind.

This book is intimate and powerful. It has strength and length, much like the silent wooden characters that are heavily featured in the text. Silent to those not listening, that is.

Still, I would not have picked this book up on my own. It was a gift from Kelly Kenneally. Thank you, Aunt Kelly, this book was a delightful bear.

### Not A Game

#### Kent Babb

As an avid fan of the NBA, particularly a fan of the Philadelphia 76ers, this book was right up my alley. Allen Iverson is a basketball icon and a legend in the city of Philadelphia. He changed the culture of the NBA in many ways. A walking highlight reel and a quote machine, I was very interested in learning more about Iverson.

I particularly enjoyed the story of Iverson's origin; it was much more chaotic and eventful than I had ever known. It not only gave context for the rest of Iverson's life, it expanded into more pithy topics like race, gender, and poverty.

As soon as Iverson's professional playing career begins, Babb never lets the reader stray too far from his portrayal of the "real" Iverson. That is the neglectful, incessantly-late, alcohol-driven, overly-stimulated, irresponsible, off-the-court Iverson. If you never saw him play, you would find it hard to believe that he could keep getting away with this behavior. Though it doesn't ask it explicitly, this book explores that question from a few different angles: what is the value of an Iverson?

The book is thorough and detailed, a critical requirement for any decent biography. It is beyond decent; it is quite good.

The tone of the book can be quite dark. I felt it was missing more light-hearted bits and stories from the Iverson peak. As a former NBA content junkie, I was waiting for interesting stories about his interactions with other notable players and coaches. Still, I can understand how that does not match the side of the story that the book is trying to tell. There are plenty of other sources from those moments; this one is here to tell us what we don't know.

### Being Mortal

#### Atul Gawande

I have always enjoyed conversing with my Dad about the medical field. His experience as a Physician Assistant has influenced my choice in education focus, career path, and general interests. Reading books together is a great way to fuel this discussion when we are not spending a lot of time together. Previously, we read [Deep Medicine]()
together. This time, though, we chose Being Mortal by Dr. Atul Gawande.

Despite the book's morbid title, it was a wonderful read. Dr. Gawande presents a well-sourced and balanced perspective on the realities of end of life care. He uses personal stories and anecdotes to color and shade the scenes that tell the history of end of life care. He paints those in his book with dignity and poise, weaving together real people with important studies and statistics. He has great skill in writing with a pleasant tone; he has a soft but strong voice, as if he is sitting close to you, keeping you calm has he gives you regrettable news. To his credit, Dr. Gawande rarely flashes his technical prowess; it seems he is more concerned with giving the reader context for a number of hard pills to swallow.

As many great books do, Being Mortal gave me hope. It changed the way I looked at my aging family members as well as the elderly population in my own community, my county, and this world. Finally, it had me asking very important questions of myself: what are my end of life expectations and what do I expect to do about the end of my life. Still, death is only half of the coin of being mortal; there is lots of life as well. This book highlights what is useful and what is important in the arena of life and death.

### Into The Woods

#### John Yorke

As a teenager, I was very interested in the arts. I performed in many musicals, I screened many movies, and even wrote a one-act play as part of my college application. (I wonder where that is.) Since then, though, I have focused my education on science and math and filled my leisure time with sports and activities. Still, my interest in movies has lasted and I finally pulled this book off of the shelf after I purchased it over five years ago.

Yorke, a British TV writer and producer, goes to great lengths to distinguish this book from a screenwriting manual. It's purpose, he stated, is to explore the origins, structure, and marks of story. Like a mirror held up to humans, analyzing story-telling is a way to study our own humanity.

The book does more than complete its mission. It is does so with many in-depth examples and tentalizing industry know-how. It is an inspring deconstruction of many scripts and stories all while exploring a deeper question; it gives the 'how' of screen-writing while answering the 'why' of story-telling.

I, personaly, was inspired to screen a number of films to seek out the marks and structure of acts, scenes, and character arc. While I have not put pen to paper since reading this book, it has certainly helped me tell stories. As I screen new films, I have to ability to break them down into their acts and arcs more then ever before. Finally, it gives many (good) answers to where stories come from and why they are so important to us.

### The Color Of Law

#### Richard Rothstein

Without a doubt, 2020 has been a most polarizing year. Economic and racial divides have been exposed and deepened. It is times like these that we must educate ourselves to make sure that we do the right thing when the opportunity for change presents itself. It is in this context and for this reason that I sought out this book.

The Color Of Law tells the story of 'de jure' segregation, a wide and long-lasting collection of government policies, actions, rulings, and choices that have led to the segregation of African Americans and the deepening racial wage gap. Though it can be slow and gruling, the book is thorough and detailed. It leaves no stone unturned as it covers federal, state, and local examples of 'de jure' segregation across the country. Many times in the book I needed to put it down to fully take in what I was reading. It is shocking and concerning how recent some of this behavoir has transpired.

I felt that the book got better as I read on. The chapters because sharper and the content more interesting to me personally. Still, as a whole, it is a great read and it gives an important perspective on what has created this issue and how we can remedy it.

### Dune

#### Frank Herbert

Dune is an epic the likes of which I have not come across in some time. After I caught the trailer for the upcoming motion picture based on the book, I was very excited to read it. After the first few pages I was hooked, entraced by its detail and narrative.

This book tells the story of a boy, wise and strong beyond his years, thrust into a great challenge. Against all odds, our protagonist must wrestle with a destiny that he can see clearly. This science fiction classic features politics, ecology, strategy and religious prophecy in an highly imagintive desert world.

Though the book is rich with character-driven narrative, I think it will make a great blockbuster.

### When Breath Becomes Air

#### Paul Kalanithi

I had heard of this book through an interview on NPR a few years ago but never managed to find my way to a copy. With only a few minutes left before the library closed, this book lurched at me. I checked it out and as soon as I cracked it open and my eyes fell upon its text, this work was tugging at my heart.

When Breath Becomes Air is trult a one-of-a-kind book written by a one-of-a-kind person. It is about life and death told my someone stradling the divide. Dr. Kalanithi is a world-class neurosurgeon on the brink off completing his training and breaking out into the world when he is diagnosed with a terminal cancer. This real-life tale is well-crafted and thoughtful as it is chilly and powerful.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is asking what makes a life meaningful and well-lived.

### Lovecraft Country

#### Matt Ruff

As you may have noticed by now, I am a sucker for books that are destined to become movies. This book, rather, was turned into an HBO series.

Succinctly, it is like The Martian Chronicles meets The Color of Law. It combines fantasy horror with the real-life equivalent for African Americans during the Jim Crow era.

This book is masterfully written and horrifyingly realistic. It is thrilling and informative.
